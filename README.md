# AI-Assignment4

I have used python programming language to work on this assignment. 

There are 2 files :
1. minimax.py: To execute this file the command on the command prompt/terminal should be

        python minimax.py

minimax.py is a program contains an implementation of the minimax algorithm for Connect Four.  This file also has methods for creating states of the board and functions for checking status of a given state. minimax algorithm is used to predict the next best possible moves while playing connect 4 game. 

2. alphabeta.py: To execute this file the command on the command prompt/terminal should be

        python alphabeta.py
 
The previous minimax python program is enhanced using alphabeta pruning. When a Four-in-a-row is made, the result is displayed to let the player know if he won or the computer won. If there are no possible moves then the message displayes is Game Over.  This makes it clear why the game ended.
